# Development Status

CURRENT PHASE: Phase 3 — Implementation
CURRENT MILESTONE: Milestone 1 — Core API, database and identity
CURRENT TASK: Define the identity lifecycle service slice on top of the validated authentication identity repository.
STATUS: Migration execution and HTTP application integration gates are validated against real CI infrastructure. CI #426 is fully green.

## Continuation protocol — READ FIRST
GitHub main is the persistent source of truth. Before every new work session:
1. Read this file.
2. Verify the files, commits and CI run named in the latest checkpoint.
3. Do not assume an unverified change passed CI.
4. Resume from the Exact next action section.
5. After every coherent implementation slice, update this file with files changed, commit SHA, CI state, unresolved constraints and the exact next action.

Never overwrite a working boundary based on conversational memory. Prefer repository state and CI evidence.

## Latest checkpoint — 2026-08-31

### HTTP application integration gate — COMPLETE
- Added real Fastify/Nest HTTP integration coverage for `GET /health` with both caller-provided and generated correlation IDs.
- Investigated repeated CI HTTP 500 responses using server-side exception logging rather than speculative production changes.
- Root cause was confirmed from CI: `HealthStatusService` was undefined in `HealthController` during the real HTTP path.
- Fixed the Nest ESM/DI boundary by explicitly injecting `HealthStatusService` with `@Inject(HealthStatusService)`.
- Extracted `configureHttpApplication()` into `apps/api/src/http-application.ts` so production bootstrap and integration tests share the same HTTP filters/hooks without importing the side-effecting entrypoint.
- CI #426 completed successfully: PostgreSQL service healthy, typecheck, lint, all tests including HTTP integration, and build passed.
- Final validated DI fix commit: `4b81f338c5dcfc39fe974d8f089560ad269920ff`.

### Account migration execution gate — COMPLETE
- `packages/database/migrations/0001_create_accounts.sql` remains grounded exclusively in the physical Prisma Account schema.
- Added migration planning/execution boundaries and tests in `packages/database/src/migrations.ts`, `packages/database/src/executor.ts`, and their tests.
- Added the API migration runner and Prisma transaction adapter.
- Added PostgreSQL integration coverage for migration apply + idempotent rerun and failed-migration rollback.
- CI provisions PostgreSQL 16 and passes `DATABASE_URL` through Turbo test tasks.
- Final rollback-test commit: `32f519d7419855802b73320ba52161b04d74e64a`.
- CI #413 completed successfully.

## Authentication/identity boundary planning — COMPLETE
- Traced the next M1 gap to PRODUCT_REQUIREMENTS.md, ARCHITECTURE.md and the technology baseline in DECISIONS.md.
- Confirmed email/password, verification and reset are required initial capabilities, while provider protocol, password algorithm and session/token transport remain unresolved.
- Added IDENTITY_AUTHENTICATION_BOUNDARY.md to prevent credentials from being mixed into Account or API transport prematurely.
- No production behavior changed in this planning slice.

## Authentication identity persistence planning — COMPLETE
- Traced DATA_MODEL_DRAFT.md AuthenticationIdentity ownership into the existing physical Account schema and migration conventions.
- Defined AUTHENTICATION_CREDENTIAL_PERSISTENCE_PLAN.md with the smallest additive authentication_identities model.
- Account remains free of authentication secrets.
- Password hashes, JWT/session state, provider payloads, verification evidence and recovery secrets remain explicitly out of this migration.

## Authentication identity persistence — COMPLETE
- Added packages/database/migrations/0002_create_authentication_identities.sql.
- Added exact Prisma AuthenticationIdentity mapping and Account relation.
- Added PostgreSQL migration integration coverage for versions 1 and 2, idempotent reruns and failed migration rollback boundaries.
- CI #434 completed successfully: PostgreSQL service, typecheck, lint, all tests and build passed.
- Persistence model contains identity linkage only; credential secrets and transport tokens remain excluded.

## Authentication identity repository boundary — COMPLETE
- Added provider-neutral AuthenticationIdentityRepository contract.
- Added PrismaAuthenticationIdentityRepository implementation.
- Added create, provider identity lookup and status update operations.
- Registered the repository through Nest DI.
- CI #439 completed successfully: PostgreSQL service, typecheck, lint, all tests and build passed.
- No credential secret, token or provider protocol was introduced.

## Exact next action
1. Add a focused AuthenticationIdentity lifecycle service above the repository boundary.
2. Centralize identity creation and lifecycle transition rules there rather than exposing repository semantics to future controllers/adapters.
3. Preserve provider neutrality and avoid credential verification/transport.
4. Add focused unit tests for create, lookup and deactivation behavior.
5. Verify CI and update the continuation checkpoint.

## Architecture constraints
- RequestPrincipal defines accountId, authenticationMethod and optional verificationLevel.
- AnonymousAuthenticationAdapter currently returns undefined.
- No JWT parser, session store, token format, or external identity-provider contract is currently grounded in the repository.
- Do not replace the legacy capability route with mandatory authentication until a real authentication adapter exists.
- Do not invent identity transport or persistence contracts.
- `packages/database/migrations` is the repository-defined migration artifact boundary.
- The Account migration is derived only from the physical Prisma schema; logical-model fields not present in Prisma are not silently added.
- PostgreSQL is the authoritative relational database and Prisma is the typed database access layer.

## Completed — DO NOT RECREATE
- Project foundation and continuity rules.
- Milestone 0 engineering foundation and CI baseline.
- Canonical domain primitives and tests.
- API application boundary.
- HTTP application integration boundary, correlation propagation and real CI verification.
- Database configuration/migration boundary.
- Account lifecycle, activation, lookup and tests.
- Entitlement lifecycle and tests.
- Verification lifecycle and verification access boundary.
- Request principal resolver boundary.
- Authenticated capability access boundary.
- Safety, moderation and audit domain foundations.
- Analytics, accessibility, operational quality, data lifecycle and deployment requirement foundations.
- Account persistence migration execution gate, including real PostgreSQL CI validation.
